# EN2091 Laboratory Practice and Project - 3 Channel Audio Mixer with 3 Band Equalizer 

Designed and implemented a compact analog audio mixer featuring three independent input channels, each with a 3-band equalizer (Bass, Mid, Treble) for precise tonal control. The system uses low-noise op-amps (NE5532, TL072), active Sallen–Key filters, and a TDA2030A Class-AB power amplifier to achieve stable, low-distortion audio mixing. 

The project involved circuit design, LTspice simulation, PCB layout with noise-reduction techniques, power supply design, enclosure modeling, and hardware testing. Developed as part of EN2091 Laboratory Practice and Projects at the University of Moratuwa
