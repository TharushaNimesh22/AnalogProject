	\begin{abstract}\\
    This project presents a compact analog audio mixer featuring three independent input channels, each equipped with a dedicated three-band equalizer—Bass (20–250 Hz), Mid (250 Hz–4 kHz), and Treble (4–20 kHz). The system enables precise tonal shaping of each channel through variable gain control stages, allowing users to amplify or attenuate specific frequency ranges according to acoustic needs. Signal processing is implemented using low-noise operational amplifiers (NE5532 and TL072), while the TDA2030A provides robust output amplification. BC547 transistors are employed for pre amplification. The mixer’s compact PCB layout ensures efficient signal routing and minimal footprint, making it suitable for portable and space-constrained applications. This design demonstrates practical applications of analog circuit principles, including multi-band filter design, signal mixing, component-level optimization, and system integration for real-world audio enhancement.

	\section{Introduction and Functionality}
With the rapid growth of content creation among entry-level artists and the general public, the demand for compact, lightweight, and cost-effective audio mixers has increased significantly. Professional-grade sound mixers, although highly capable, are often expensive and bulky, making them unsuitable for beginners and small-scale applications.

To address this limitation, there is a growing need for portable and user-friendly audio mixing devices that offer essential audio processing features without excessive complexity. Audio mixers play a vital role in combining multiple audio sources and adjusting signal levels to achieve balanced and high-quality sound output.

The Three Channel Audio Mixer with Equalizers, developed by Circuit Pirates, is designed to fulfill this requirement. The system enables users to mix three independent audio inputs while providing equalization control to adjust low, mid, and high frequency components. This makes the mixer suitable for applications such as music recording, podcast production, live streaming, and educational audio experiments, where simplicity, affordability, and performance are equally important.

\subsection{Pre Amplifier}
\subsubsection*{Mic Pre-amplifier}
For the mic pre-amplifier we used a cascaded transistor based amplifier in common emitter configuration with voltage divider bias.This ensured the thermal stability and the preferred gain.(gain ~160) Moderate input impedance and high output impedance was required by the mic input, this BJT configuration ensured these needs.
\subsubsection*{Instrument Pre-amplifier}
For the instrument pre amplifier high input impedance was required. So TL072 which is a JFET OPAMP is used since it requires very low input bias current.
Non inverting amplifier is used with few modifications added to filter DC signals and stabilize the output.

\subsection{Equalizers}
Unity gain band-pass filters are implemented by cascading a second-order Sallen–Key low-pass filter with a second-order Sallen–Key high-pass filter. This configuration enables independent adjustment of the lower and upper cutoff frequencies, thereby providing flexible control over the passband characteristics.

Similar to the low-pass filter, by selecting \( R_1 = R_2 = R \) and \( C_1 = C_2 = C \), the cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter simplifies to
\[
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}.

The above high-pass and low-pass filters are cascaded to form the unity gain band-pass filter.

	\section{PCB Design}
   We implemented a modular approach where we used 3 separate PCB s for the channels and a single PCB to combine and power amplify the signal. The power supply was made as a separate PCB to reduce the power supply noise interference with audio.

\subsection*{Signal Integrity and Noise Reduction}
The PCB layout was created with a focus on reducing noise and maintaining signal integrity. Sensitive input paths were routed away from switching or high-current nodes, and low-level audio traces were kept as brief as possible to minimize interference. 

\subsection*{Grounding Strategy}
To avoid ground loops and get a clear audio performance, a star-ground strategy was used. Analog grounds for each channel were separated throughout the board and joined only at a single point. 

\subsection*{Power Supply and Decoupling}
Each channel was provided with local decoupling capacitors, combining 100\,nF ceramic capacitors for high-frequency filtering and 10\,µF electrolytic capacitors for reducing low-frequency voltage ripple. The power supply section was \textbf{physically isolated} from the audio signal paths, ensuring clean ±12\,V rails for the mixer.

\subsection*{Component Placement and Routing}
In order to support both mechanical usability and electrical performance, component placement was optimised. To reduce loop area, op-amps were positioned near their corresponding feedback networks. Potentiometers were positioned for front-panel mounting, and input connectors were placed close to the preamplifier stage to minimise trace length. Thinner traces were used for low-level audio signals, and wider traces were used for power and output paths.

\subsection*{Thermal and Mechanical Considerations}
Thermal considerations were taken into consideration even though the mixer mostly uses low-power analogue components. To enable heat dissipation, components like output drivers and voltage regulators were positioned close to the board's edges. 
We used a cooling fan to maximize the air flow and hence effectively cool down the power amplifier and voltage regulator ICs.

	\section{Enclosure Design}
    The enclosure was designed to protect the electronic components from mechanical damage and to electrically isolate them from the user. The overall dimensions of the enclosure are 17.5 cm in width and 22.5 cm in length. The height of the shorter side is 3.6 cm, while the taller side has a height of 7.0 cm. A wall thickness of 3 mm was selected to increase the mechanical strength and rigidity of the enclosure.

% \vspace{0.5em} 
% \noindent
A space with dimensions of 7 cm × 17.5 cm and a constant height of 7.0 cm was reserved for placing the transformer and the cooling fan. All PCBs, except the power supply PCB, were mounted vertically inside the enclosure and secured using screws.

% \vspace{0.5em} 
% \noindent
Ventilation holes were provided on both the left and right sides, as well as on the rear side of the enclosure, to facilitate adequate airflow and heat dissipation. Polylactic Acid (PLA) was selected as the material for 3D printing.

% \vspace{0.5em} 
% \noindent
To reduce the overall 3D printing cost, two bottom support structures were printed as separate components and subsequently attached to the enclosure during assembly.

    \subsection*{Conclusion}


    In this project, a 3-Channel Audio Mixer with a 3-Band Equalizer was successfully designed and implemented. The system allows independent control of low, mid, and high frequency bands for each input channel, providing flexibility in audio mixing and tone shaping. By using operational amplifiers, active RC filter networks, and proper buffering techniques, the mixer achieves stable operation with minimal distortion and acceptable noise performance.

    The mixer effectively combines multiple audio inputs into a single output while maintaining signal integrity. The practical implementation validated the theoretical design concepts studied in analog electronics, such as filter design, gain control, and signal summing. Testing results confirmed that the equalizer provides noticeable frequency adjustment and the overall system performs reliably for basic audio applications such as small audio setups, educational demonstrations, and laboratory use.

    This project enhanced our understanding of analog audio signal processing, circuit debugging, PCB layout considerations, and real-world implementation challenges.




    \subsection*{Future Work}
    


    Although the current design meets the project objectives, several improvements can be considered for future development:


    Class-D Power Amplifier Integration: The current system uses a Class-AB power amplifier, which provides good audio quality but has relatively lower efficiency and higher power dissipation. In future versions, a Class-D power amplifier can be implemented to significantly improve power efficiency, reduce heat generation, and enable compact and portable designs.
    Additional Channels: Expanding the design to support more input channels for advanced mixing applications.
    Balanced Inputs and Outputs: Implementing balanced XLR or TRS connectors to reduce noise and interference in professional audio environments.
    Power Supply Enhancement: Designing a regulated and isolated power supply to further reduce hum and noise.
    User Interface Improvements: Adding LED level indicators or VU meters to visually monitor signal levels.
    Enclosure Optimization: Improving mechanical design for better portability, durability, and thermal management.
    Bluetooth or USB Audio Support: Adding wireless or USB audio interfaces for modern connectivity.
    With these enhancements, the audio mixer can be transformed into a more versatile and professional-grade audio processing system suitable for wider real-world applications.
